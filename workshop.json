  "Title": "The Labyrinthine Trail",
  "Description": "Occasionally, an adventurer will stumble across a fork, tines sharp and sensitive, that yearns to go home. The stories say that if you follow the hum of one of these finding forks, it will lead you to fabulous treasure, stashed away between the folds of the world. Of course, the stories also warn that the cry of a finding fork is distinctive and attracts misfortune and lead slugs. ",
