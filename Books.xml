Found a cave full of centipedes. Bit lots of holes in my shoes. Tried to cook one up, but the meat fell apart. Sticking to beetles.

Found a crusty old revolver. Cleaned it up. Can probably swap it for some new shoes. Nothing else spoke to me.

So much slime. Keep falling over. Miss my shoes.

Found a fork. Old Eater stuff. It tells my it wants to return home. Same little fork, same.

Found the end of the cave. Shot up some nasty looking snapjaws.

Still talking with the fork. It's telling me there's treasure at its home. It's telling me its a home-finder, and a key.

The fork's telling me more about the treasure. Masks covered in jewels. Just one, and I'd be rich enough to drown.

Found some holes in the ground. I can hear the whirring and sparking of machinery. Must be good stuff down there. Will try the cave tomorrow.

But after that, resupply, then I'll take this little fork home.</page>
